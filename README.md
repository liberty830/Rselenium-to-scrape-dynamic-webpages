# Rselenium-to-scrape-dynamic-webpages

This is a practice for web scraping using Rselenium package for dynamic web pages.
Dynamic web scraping means our crawlers should do some actions to get the information we need. 
For example, the crawler should click "Load More" button to load more reviews to scrape them. ("https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1520211/reviews?ref_=tt_ql_3")
Or, we can make our crawler type a word in the Google search engine to scrape the results.

I tried this scraping method in an example of IMDB reviews collecting. It requires me to click "Load-More" button to load more reviews. 
I attached my codes for this and result of a data frame.
